### Microbiome analysis notebooks and software

Software and Jupyter notebooks for the microbiome analyses were primarily developed by J Gregory Caporaso ([Caporaso Lab](http://caporasolab.us), Center for Microbial Genetics and Genomics, Northern Arizona University). These can be found in the [16S directory of this repository](./16S). Questions should be directed to gregcaporaso@gmail.com.

Microbiome analysis commands are [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Cvj9IaotT1PJnb6lE9d3EbebMNVJT10xUpIWtkyYwtw/edit?usp=sharing).

### Virome analysis software and data

Data and software supporting the virome analyses were primarily developed by Ann Gregory (Sullivan Lab, Ohio State University). These can be found the [virome directory of this repository](./virome). Questions should be directed to anin.gregory@gmail.com.

## Eighteen-month follow-up (currently in review)

Corresponding sample metadata is [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/so40kmp8nxkfhly/sample-metadata.tsv?dl=0).

The analysis code has been updated to use [QIIME 2](https://qiime2.org), and can be found in [the `18-month-followup` branch of this repository](https://github.com/caporaso-lab/autism-fmt1/tree/18-month-followup).
